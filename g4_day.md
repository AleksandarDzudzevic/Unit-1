# How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?
#### Precisly answering this question isn't possible because our memories are constantly updating,
#### but if we were to say that the amount of data that our brain recieves is equal to the amount that it delets (things that we forget over time) we would be able to get somewhat consistant answer.
 If take an avarege well educated (graduated from uni) adult I would say he knows informations equivelent to around 1 000 000 000 books. Now this might sound like too much 
but keep in mind that just knowing how to breathe also counts as an information.
  Avarage book has around 300 pages which is equivalent to around 0.6 MB whcih all together is 0.6x 1 000 000 000 = 600 000 000 MB= 60 000GB of plain text
  And if add high resolution videos and photos that we keep in our brain it would be at least 50 times more which would be 3 000 000GB which is total of 3.1 000 000GB
P.S if person is not very educated and if it doesnt go out much this number will be lower.
## To conclude my answer would be 775 000 4GB usb memories.
