# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions with update the SOL price.
4. The electronic ledger asks the real time price of the coin and then 
The electroni ledger shows the porfolio value change(%) calculating and displaying the : value of current porfolio/total amount invested+/- expenses x100% using th eprice change from the last time
5.Tracker of the expenses with the value displayed i USD$ and in crypto value(using the latest value input of SOL)(Possibly a colored graph as well)
6. The ledger analysis the porfolio change and withdrawal and deposit history, and then gives some of the following suggestions: Warning for spending crypto while its price is one of the lowest ever inputed, or saying that its a good time to exchange it to dollars. (basically DCA with a conclusion)
